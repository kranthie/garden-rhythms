1.1-1
Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.
a. Sorting is required to rank the candidates for a university admission based on their scores.
Todo: Is immage detection a good example for a convex hull?  Linear programming is a good example.
1.1-2
Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-
world setting?
a. Memory/storage required.  What are the others?
1.1-3
Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths 
and limitations.
a. Array is known to everyone.  The strength is the quick access to the constituent elements.  Weakness is of course to do with not being able to extend it beyond its current size without copying all the elements.
1.14
How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? 
How are they different?
a. They are simalar in the sense that we need to find the shortest way to connect a bunch of points.  They are different since the traveling salesman has to cover every point and only once.
1.1-5
Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then 
come up with one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good 
enough.
a. The best solution is required when it comes to routing an ambulance carrying patients who are in a critical situation.  When you search for a string in a resonably small document, an approximately best search algorithm is sufficient.
